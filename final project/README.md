# Fork Recipes

Fork Recipes is a web application that allows users to search for recipes from all around the world. The application is built entirely using JavaScript, and users can search for recipes by entering the name of the recipe they are looking for. In addition, users can also upload their own recipes to share with the community.

## Architecture

Fork Recipes is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This means that the application's code is organized into three main components:

- Model: This component represents the application's data and business logic. In Fork Recipes, the model is responsible for managing the recipe data, validating user inputs, and handling database interactions.

- View: This component is responsible for rendering the application's user interface. In Fork Recipes, the view is responsible for displaying the search results, recipe details, and submission forms.

- Controller: This component acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. In Fork Recipes, the controller is responsible for handling user actions, such as submitting a search query or uploading a recipe, and updating the model and view accordingly.
